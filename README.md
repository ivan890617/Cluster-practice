# Cluster-practice

Hourly Energy Consumption Data Classification

Data:Provided by PJM in Megawatts

We can diveded this practice into two case 

## Case 1:Clust time series data into 3 group and each group can clust into 3 sub-cluster,so we will get 9 clusters.

## Case 2:time series classification with LSTM model
