# Cluster-practice

Hourly Energy Consumption Data Classification

Data:Provided by PJM in Megawatts

This practice included three file:

    README.md

    kmeans.ipynb

    LSTM_classification.ipynb

We can diveded this practice into two case 

## Case 1:
### Clust time series data into 3 group and each group can clust into 3 sub-cluster,so we will get 9 clusters.
In this case,first,clust the time series data by kmeans algorithm into three group(three Energy-Consumption-Level)

Next step,cluste each group into three sub-cluster(three sub-Energy-Consumption-Level)

The detail code can see the **kmeans.ipynb**
## Case 2:
### time series classification with LSTM model
